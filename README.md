Drag: Users can drag the image within the safe zone for positioning.
Zoom: Zoom in/out functionality is available for detailed viewing.
Rotate: Images can be rotated for better orientation.
Crop: Upon saving, the image is automatically cropped according to the guide, while also keeping the original image.
